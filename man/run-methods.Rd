\usage{
run(model, threads = NULL, seed = NULL, U = NULL, V = NULL)

\S4method{run}{siminf_model}(model, threads = NULL, seed = NULL, U = NULL,
  V = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The siminf model to run.}

\item{threads}{Number of threads. Default is NULL, i.e. to use the
number of available processors.}

\item{seed}{Random number seed. Default is NULL, i.e. to use a
time-seed.}

\item{U}{Write the number of individuals in each compartment at
\code{tspan} to the non-zero elements in \code{U}, where
\code{U} is a sparse matrix, \code{dgCMatrix}, with dimension
\eqn{N_n N_c \times} \code{length(tspan)}. Default is
\code{NULL} i.e. to write the number of inidividuals in each
compartment in every node to a dense matrix.}

\item{V}{Write the real-valued continuous state at \code{tspan} to
the non-zero elements in \code{V}, where \code{V} is a sparse
matrix, \code{dgCMatrix}, with dimension
\eqn{N_n}\code{dim(ldata)[1]} \eqn{\times}
\code{length(tspan)}. Default is \code{NULL} i.e. to write the
real-valued continuous state to a dense matrix.}
}
\value{
\code{siminf_model} with result from simulation.
