\title{Create a SISe model}
\usage{
SISe(init, tspan, events = NULL, initial_infectious_pressure = NULL,
  response = NULL, recover = NULL, alpha = NULL, beta_q1 = NULL,
  beta_q2 = NULL, beta_q3 = NULL, beta_q4 = NULL, epsilon = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{init}{A \code{data.frame} with the initial state in each
node, see details.}

\item{tspan}{An increasing sequence of points in time where the
state of the system is to be returned.}

\item{events}{a \code{data.frame} with the scheduled events, see
\code{\link{siminf_model}}.}

\item{initial_infectious_pressure}{A numeric vector with the
initial environmental infectious pressure in each node. Default
NULL which gives 0 in each node.}

\item{response}{The response rate from susceptible to infected}

\item{recover}{The recover rate from infected to susceptible}

\item{alpha}{The shed rate}

\item{beta_q1}{The decay of the environmental infectious pressure
in the first quarter of the year.}

\item{beta_q2}{The decay of the environmental infectious pressure
in the second quarter of the year.}

\item{beta_q3}{The decay of the environmental infectious pressure
in the third quarter of the year.}

\item{beta_q4}{The decay of the environmental infectious pressure
in the fourth quarter of the year.}

\item{epsilon}{The background infectious pressure}

\description{
Create a SISe model to be used by the simulation framework.
}
\details{
The argument init must be a \code{data.frame} with the following
columns:
\describe{
\item{id}{Node identifier that uniquely identifies each node. The
node identifiers must be zero-based, i.e. the first identifier
must be equal to zero.}
\item{S}{The number of sucsceptible}
\item{I}{The number of infected}
}
}
