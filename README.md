# SimInf

Livestock movements are important for the spread of many infectious
diseases between herds. The package provides an efficient and flexible
framework for data-driven stochastic disease spread modelling that
integrates within-herd infection dynamics as continuous-time Markov
chains and livestock movements between herds as scheduled events. The
core simulation solver is implemented in C and uses OpenMP (if
available) to divide work over multiple processors. The package
contains template models and can be extended with user defined models.

## Installation

To install the latest release on CRAN


```r
install.packages("SimInf")
```

To install the development version of `SimInf`, it's easiest to use
the devtools package:


```r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("stewid/SimInf"")
```

Another alternative is to use `git` and `make`


```r
$ git clone https://github.com/stewid/SimInf.git
$ cd SimInf
$ make install
```

### Dependencies

#### On a Debian based system

Before installing `SimInf` you need to install
[The GNU Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) (GSL).
