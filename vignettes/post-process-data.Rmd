After a model is created, a simulation is started with a call to the
`run()` function with the model as the first argument. The function
returns a modified model object with a single stochastic solution
trajectory attached to it. Trajectory data contains the state of each
compartment, recorded at every time-point in `tspan`. This document
introduces you to functionality in `SimInf` to post-process and
explore that trajectory data.

## Extract trajectory data with `trajectory()`

## Calculate prevalence from trajectory with `prevalence()`

## Visualize trajectory with `plot()`
