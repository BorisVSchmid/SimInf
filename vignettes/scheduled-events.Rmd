## Overview

Incorporate births, deaths and movements as scheduled events at
predefined time-points.

## A first example

Now we'll define **4** events to include in the simulation. Below is a
`data.frame`, that contains the movements. Interpret it as follows:

1. In time step **3** we move **1** animal from herd **1** to herd **2**
2. In time step **4** we move **1** animal from herd **1** to herd **3**
3. In time step **4** we move **1** animal from herd **1** to herd **4**
2. In time step **5** we move **2** animals from herd **1** to herd
   **5**

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
events <- data.frame(
    event      = c(3, 3, 3, 3),  ## Event type 3 is a movement between herds
    time       = c(3, 4, 4, 5),  ## The time that the event happens
    node       = c(1, 1, 1, 1),  ## Which herd does the event occur
    dest       = c(2, 3, 4, 5),  ## Which is the destination herd
    n          = c(1, 1, 1, 2),  ## how many animals are moved
    proportion = c(0, 0, 0, 0),  ## This is not used when n > 0
    select     = c(2, 2, 2, 2),  ## 2nd column in select matrix
    shift      = c(0, 0, 0, 0))  ## Not used in this example
```
