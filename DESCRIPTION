Description: Livestock movements are important for the spread of many
    infectious diseases in animal populations. SimInf is an efficient
    and flexible framework for stochastic disease spread modelling and
    integrates within-node infectious dynamics as continuous-time
    Markov chains (Gillespie's direct method) and livestock movements
    between nodes as scheduled events. The core simulation solver is
    implemented in C and uses OpenMP to divide work over multiple
    processors.
