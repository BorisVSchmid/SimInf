/**
 * Structure that represents external events.

 * - event Integer vector of length len with external events.
 * - time Integer vector of length len with the time for external event.
 * - select Integer vector of length len. Column j in the event matrix that
     determines the hidden states to sample from.
 * - node Integer vector of length len. The source node of the event i.
 * - dest Integer vector of length len. The dest node of the event i.
 * - n Integer vector of length len. The number of individuals in the
     external event. n[i] >= 0.
 * - proportion Integer vector of length len. If n[i] equals zero, then the
 *   number of individuals to sample is calculated by summing the number of
 *   individuals in the hidden states determined by select[i] and multiplying
 *   with the proportion. 0 <= p[i] <= 1.
 * - len Number of scheduled external events.
